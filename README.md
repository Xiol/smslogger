SMS Logger
==========

In Tasker on Android you can configure it to make a HTTP POST request on an incoming SMS message. This thing accepts those requests and logs the SMS to a database for later retrieval.

The code here is likely terrible. This has been thrown together pretty quickly. The web interface has also been designed so I don't have to write a single line of JS, because why would I do that to myself?
